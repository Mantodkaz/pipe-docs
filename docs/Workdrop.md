Node Operators (TestNet and DevNet nodes) - For the first 12 months following mainnet launch, all node operators—including those who participated in the DevNet and TestNet phases—will receive a 1:1 matching contribution on all bandwidth delivered.

In practical terms, this means your monthly PIPE rewards will be doubled for the first year.

This incentive is designed to reward and empower the operators who actively contribute to scaling and strengthening the network during its early growth phase.

The Pipe Foundation also reserves the right to conduct mid-month "workdrops" based on verified mainnet node performance, in addition to the standard monthly rewards distribution.

To qualify, DevNet and TestNet node operators must continue running their mainnet nodes using the same Solana wallet address previously submitted during testing.

To ensure equitable access to resources, storage and bandwidth credits will be granted to all Node Operators and Pipe Firestarter storage users. This gesture is made in appreciation of their continued contributions to the community.
