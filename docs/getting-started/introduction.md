# Introduction

Pipe Network is the **permissionless full-stack cloud**, designed to deliver, store, and route data with hyperscaler-grade performance — but built on a fundamentally different architecture. Instead of relying on centralized data centers, Pipe leverages a fabric of **hyperlocal PoP (Points of Presence) nodes** operated permissionlessly around the world.

## The Power of Pipe PoP Nodes

Conventional CDNs place infrastructure in a handful of metro hubs. Pipe's innovation is its **hyperlocalized PoP nodes**, deployed as close as ~50 miles from end users — inside ISP facilities, local IXPs, or even community-operated locations.

These PoPs offer:

- **Ultra-low latency**: sub‑10ms RTTs, often approaching LAN-like speeds
- **Higher throughput**: optimized TCP performance due to reduced Bandwidth‑Delay Product (BDP)
- **Resilience**: no single points of failure, with dynamic routing around congestion and outages
- **Accessibility**: coverage in underserved and rural regions where hyperscalers rarely deploy

## Products

Pipe Network provides a unified stack built on the PoP fabric:

- **Pipe CDN**: Hyperlocal content delivery designed for video, gaming, dApps, and AI workloads
- **Firestarter Storage**: Decentralized origin storage integrated with delivery
- **P1 Overlay Network**: A software-defined routing layer that stitches the fastest paths across multiple networks

## Pipe vs. Hyperscalers

| Feature | Hyperscalers | Pipe Network |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Infrastructure Model** | Centralized data centers in limited regions | Distributed hyperlocal PoP nodes run permissionlessly |
| **Latency** | Optimized regionally, often >20ms | Sub‑10ms from hyperlocal PoPs |
| **Scalability** | Requires capital‑intensive buildout | Scales organically as new participants deploy PoPs |
| **Control** | Centralized ownership and governance | Community‑driven, permissionless participation |
| **Economics** | Proprietary pricing models | Transparent, market-driven pricing |
