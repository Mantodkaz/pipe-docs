# Architecture

Pipe Network's decentralized architecture is designed to revolutionize content delivery through innovative approaches:

## Node Structure and Hyperlocal PoP Strategy

The network features hyperlocal Points of Presence (PoP) nodes that:
- Are strategically deployed to minimize latency
- Allow independent operators to deploy nodes in local regions
- Create a "permissionless" system where anyone with appropriate hardware can contribute
- Provide content delivery optimization and improved performance

## Content Distribution and Caching Mechanism

Key characteristics include:
- Distributed caching at hyperlocal PoP nodes
- A Cache Management System (CMS) coordinating content
- Future plans for peer-to-peer node connections
- Reduced long-distance data transfers
- More efficient bandwidth usage

## Solana Blockchain Integration

The network leverages Solana blockchain for:
- High throughput
- Low transaction costs
- Decentralized network control via smart contracts
- Transparent, immutable transaction recording
- Scalability without performance compromise

The architecture aims to deliver content "quickly and securely across the globe" by reimagining traditional centralized content delivery networks.
