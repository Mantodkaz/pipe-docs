# $PIPE Tokenomics

Pipe Network is a decentralized CDN protocol on Solana that uses blockchain incentives to create a globally distributed network of PoP nodes, delivering faster, cheaper, and more reliable content delivery.

## Token Utility

PIPE is a multi-utility token serving five primary roles:

- **Staking**: Node operators stake PIPE to participate in the network, improving reputation and selection likelihood
- **Delegated Staking**: Token holders can delegate PIPE to active nodes and earn proportional rewards
- **Payments via Data Credits (DCs)**: Users burn PIPE to mint DCs for content delivery and storage
- **Priority Services**: Users pay in DCs for enhanced CDN services like faster delivery and premium caching
- **Governance**: Staked PIPE grants voting rights on protocol upgrades, emissions, and key economic parameters

## Data Credit Model

Pipe introduces a dual-token architecture where PIPE is converted into non-transferable Data Credits (DCs) used to pay for CDN services:

- Conversion = PIPE burned to mint DCs
- Pricing based on oracle-driven rates
- DCs expire after 30-day epochs

## Emission Model

The network uses a demand-driven mint-and-burn model:

- DC Purchases burn PIPE
- PIPE minted based on DCs burned
- 100% of rewards go to bandwidth
- 7% of node rewards allocated to individual stakers

## Service Economics

The platform introduces an auction-style marketplace for:

- Priority Bandwidth
- Priority Cache

## Network Security & Governance

- Staking-based Sybil resistance
- Cryptographic proofs of delivery
- Decentralized governance via staked PIPE
- Ongoing third-party audits and bug bounties

## Token Supply & Sustainability

- Controlled emissions
- Stake lockups
- Consumption equilibrium
- Governance-controlled adjustments
- Potential future supply cap

The native token, PIPE, powers everything from staking and governance to bandwidth purchases through Data Credits (DCs).
