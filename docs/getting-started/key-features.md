# Key Features

Pipe Network's decentralized CDN model is designed to address the specific needs of modern content delivery. By combining innovative technology with a robust feature set, Pipe Network offers a unique solution for businesses, developers, and users seeking to optimize content distribution.

## 1. Hyperlocal Pipe PoP Nodes

Pipe Network's hyperlocal Points of Presence (PoP) nodes are a fundamental aspect of the network's performance and efficiency. These PoP nodes are deployed in localized areas, enabling content to be delivered from the closest possible node to the end-user, significantly reducing latency. Unlike traditional CDNs that concentrate nodes in major cities, Pipe Network's decentralized model allows nodes to be set up in any region, including underserved and remote areas. This helps achieve true real-time data delivery across the globe.

## 2. Cost Efficiency

One of Pipe Network's core goals is to provide a cost-effective alternative to centralized CDNs. With its decentralized infrastructure and a blockchain-based system, Pipe Network can deliver content at a significantly lower price. The burn-mint equilibrium system ensures that users only pay for what they use, with Data Credits being consumed as data is transferred.

## 3. Real-time Data Delivery

Pipe Network outperforms competitors in real-time content delivery by leveraging its decentralized, hyperlocal PoP nodes. The proximity of these nodes to users minimizes latency, ensuring that data is delivered faster than traditional CDNs. This is particularly important for applications requiring real-time responsiveness, such as live video streaming, gaming, and real-time communications.

## 4. Security and Data Integrity

Pipe Network incorporates several advanced security features to ensure data integrity and protect against malicious attacks:

- **DDoS Protection**: The network provides built-in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection for endpoints, mitigating the risk of attacks that could overwhelm content delivery.

- **DMCA Complaint System**: Pipe Network has a backend system that allows customers to file and manage Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) complaints. The system parses URLs and connects them to the relevant customer, ensuring that content takedown requests are handled efficiently and securely.

- **IP Allowlisting**: Customers can enable IP allowlisting to restrict access to their content, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve data from the network.
